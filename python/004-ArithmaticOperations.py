x = 5

### Normal assignment operators ###
# x = x + 1
# x = x - 1
# x = x * 2
# x = x / 2
# x = x // 2   |====> Floor division (rounds down)
# x = x % 2

### Aumented assignment operators ###
# Augmented way -> x += 1
# Augmented way -> x -= 1
# Augmented way -> x *= 2
# Augmented way -> x /= 2
# Augmented way -> x //= 2
# Augmented way -> x %= 2

print(x)
