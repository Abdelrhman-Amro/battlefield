> Master Node JS & Deno.js, build REST APIs with Node.js, GraphQL APIs, add Authentication, use MongoDB, SQL & much more!

### How To Navigate This Repository

1. The `code` folder is separated into the different course sections

    - each section contains multiple snapshots throughout the section

2. The `attachments` folder is also separated into different course sections and contains any relevant attachments from the section, as well as starting snapshots (if applicable)

3. The `slides` folder contains a single pdf document of all the slides in this course
    - I may split it up in the future, but I've already spent a tremendous amount of time compiling this repository, so it will have to be a later date.

### Some Additional Considerations

-   I went through this course in its entirety, **every lecture**.
-   While some libraries have changed their syntax slightly, the concepts taught throughout the sections are still applicable today.
-   I have deviated _as little as possible_ from Max's original code, and have sprinkled notes about some of the things that have changed in the code
-   When in doubt on why something is not working as you might expect it to, please do your best to compare your code to mine. You would be wise to also consult the relevant library's documentation.
-   In addition, please search the course Q & A section **before** you make a new question, as whatever issue you are facing, has likely been faced before.

> p.s. it is entirely possible I may have made a mistake in my code or there is some bug that I might have missed correcting, please forgive me as I am only a lowly developer like yourself ğŸ˜…
