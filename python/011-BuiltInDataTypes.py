##### Definitions #####
# list
    # An ordered collection of items that can be modified.
# set
    # An unordered collection of unique items that cannot be modified once created.
# tuple
    # An ordered collection of immutable items that cannot be modified once created.

##### Use Cases #####
# list
    # Storing multiple items that need to be accessed by index.
    # Modifying individual elements, such as adding, removing, or changing values.
# sets
    # Ensuring uniqueness of elements in a collection.
    # Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference to manipulate collections.
# tuple
    # Storing data that should not be changed, such as coordinates or a date.
    # Returning multiple values from a function in a single, readable object.
# dictionary
    # Quick lookups based on unique keys, such as searching for a name in a phone book.
    # Storing related data together in a structured format, like user information with keys for name, age, and email.
